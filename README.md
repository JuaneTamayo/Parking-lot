# Parkify
## The Application

### A world in constant motion

We live in a world where being able to do things faster has become a necessity to the point where even five minutes can feel like an eternity. This is related with the fact that finding a parking space is more difficult everyday due to the constant increase of traffic; therefore, it makes this a tedious process, taking longer than what the world around us demands. Having no way to be able to explore an entire parking lot, one begins to lose time by small amounts a day until it becomes a tremendous total when adding those minutes in a lifetime; however, gas is also wasted in the process.

### What is Parkify?

Parkify is an application that aims to solve this simple activity that takes one's precious time, so you are able to find a spot to park your car in faster an effective way than by searching around. It is a simple solution which manages to separate a parking lot in different zones and tells you how many spaces are free in each of this areas. Also, when Parkify gets to know you better, it will be able to priotize the closest empty parking zones near your destination. This way, looking for a parking spot can stop being a stressful chore and become an easy daily step.

### How Parkify is achieved

This application was built from the ground up by utilizing an Intel Edison Board and simulating a parking environment with the use of sensors to mark the entry and exit of cars in an area, a database stored in a web server as well as a communication with the application through the use of .json files. To put it simply, we have an application which communicates utilizing a ssh protocol to the Edison and to a database, whenever an entry or exit sensor is triggered, the the app will change accordingly.
## Hardware and software
### Intel Edison
The Intel Edison board will be utilizing a button to count a car occupying a new space, a touch sensor to represent a car leaving a free space, and an LCD screen which lists the number of free parking spots and changes color between green, yellow, and red depending on this number, with green being more than half parking spaces available, yellow being half or less spaces available, and red when there is no availability left; The updates can only be received from the sensors after an interval of 0.05 seconds. The whole development for the Edison can be found in this link.

#### Image Recognition
We have implementated the use of a camera in order to be able to detect license plates and to identify the cars entering the parking lot area; however, this feature is still in progress. It will capture video constantly and will take a picture whenever a license plate enters its field of view and then it will save the image and restart the camera so it is ready to detect another plate. Though this implementation isnâ€™t complete yet, a rough version of the code is found here:

### Web service
We also included within the Intel Edison, we will be using its IP address to host a web server which will be used to display the main webpage of Parkify made utilizing a Materialize template as well as giving you the option to create your own parking space for the use of the application. The css and necessary scripts for it to run correctly can be found here as well as the server:

https://github.com/iotchallenge2016/development_card/blob/950f8b029e6447204472b0a2a5b5659d0c9766be/server.py

The server will not only manage the webpage, but it will also be in charge of reading the initial state of the parking lot's areas of through a csv file through a loader py file, then we have a another py file that makes requests to the server and writes into the lcd of the Edison with the use of its sensors. Finally we have another file which states when a request is invalid.

##__Parking Lot__

For the construction of this software, the Tecnologico de Monterrey Campus Gualadajara's parking lot was used as a prototype example. The parking lot in this campus consists in ten different areas with the following parking spaces:

Zone | Parking Spaces
---|:---:
Medicine | 412
Visitors | 237
Congress Center | 288
Residences | 230
Civil Engineering | 291
Engineering | 446
Media | 229
Library | 269
Cafeteria | 341 
Entrance | 270

The following image is the campus' parking lot divided by zones.

##__How does it works?__

###__Sensors__

With the use of sensors, our program is able to detect the movement in front of them. This with the purpose of detecting wheter a car is exiting or entering a certain zone of the parking lot. 

This way our main system is able to keep count of how many cars are currently in the parking lot; therefore, it will get the number of available spaces. By keeping the count, we are also able to classify zones' disponibility by colors. This way it is easier for the user to keep track of the empty spaces since the LCD brights in that certain color. This was made by setting a maximum and minimum of Flags and assigning a value to each color: 

```Python 3
#Limits
MAX = 20
MIN = 0

#Limit flags

RedFlag = 0
YellowFlag = 10

 # ------ LCD -------
        #Red = 252, 18, 33
        #Amarillo = 229, 220, 22
        #Verde = 46, 254, 67

    if(lugares <= RedFlag):
        myLcd.setColor(252, 18, 3)

    elif(lugares <= YellowFlag):
        myLcd.setColor(229, 220, 22)

    else:
        myLcd.setColor(46, 254, 67)

    messages = "Disponibles: " + str(lugares) + " "
    myLcd.setCursor(0,0)
    myLcd.write(messages)
```
